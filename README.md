# Genetic Algorithm vs K-Means for Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to perform clustering on the **Superstore dataset** and compares its performance with the classical **K-Means algorithm**.  
The project includes:
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features).
- Implementation of a Genetic Algorithm for clustering.
- Comparison with K-Means using **Silhouette Score**.
- Visualization of clustering results.
